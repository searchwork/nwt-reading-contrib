# Welcome

Welcome to the former support repository for the NWT Reading app.

**Important Notice:** This version of NWT Reading is deprecated and no longer maintained. The NWT Reading app has been open-sourced and development has moved to a new repository.

We recommend switching to the new version: [new repository](https://github.com/searchwork/nwt-reading)

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to the new NWT Reading app! You can find details on contributing in the new repository's README.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the NWT Reading app meet the [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) of the [jw.org](https://jw.org) site?

It does, as the following paragraphs of the [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) show:

> What constitutes proper use? Subject to the restrictions set out below, you may:
>
> ...
>
> Share links to or electronic copies of downloadable publications, videos, or audio programs on this site.

Besides its main purpose of keeping track of the personal Bible reading program, the NWT Reading app did exactly what is described above: it shared links to the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures as a convenience for the user. The corresponding jw.org web page with the Bible text was opened in a browser widget.

> You may not:
>
> ...
>
> Distribute artwork, electronic publications, trademarks, music, photos, text, or videos from this website with or as part of any software application (including uploading such materials to a server for use by a software application).

The NWT Reading app did not contain copyrighted material. It only linked to the jw.org web site.

The other paragraphs in the Terms of Use do obviously not apply to this app.
